The winners would move on to the next round. Both winners and losers recieved positive reinforcement corresponding to the winning moves, and negative reinforcement corresponding the the losing moves.

Perhaps the character stubs their toe on a chair, or tries to use the wrong door. Traditionally, all of those interactions would need to be scripted, which accounts for their rarity.
